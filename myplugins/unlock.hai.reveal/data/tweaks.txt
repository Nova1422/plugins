			`	Word of your status in human space also seems to have spread ahead of you, especially considering your apparent reputation on many Hai worlds as one of the few significant human visitors. A small crowd of Hai gather to peek at you on the short walk from the spaceport to the government building you are led to.`

			`	You haven't really seen very much of the Hai so far, and you can't help but think the size of the detachment is rather militant of them. It's impossible to judge if it's for your safety or whether, given your status as a "war hero", it's for theirs.`

			`	You arrive at a very comfortable office and are received by a mature-looking Hai with the appropriate regalia of a diplomat. She holds out a paw to greet you and says, "My name is Sayari. I was the envoy to the human government a century ago."`
			`	The present media storm is all the evidence needed to make it clear that the Republic has never mentioned the Hai, nor publicly acknowledged receiving an envoy from them. If they're in on the secret, then they're probably still trying to work out a suppression strategy and have been too busy to send an envoy quicker than your own trip took.`
			`	Sayari continues, "Our reports tell us that you are a well-known and respected individual in human space. We also know 'Hai' is quickly becoming a buzzword in your space. A few traders brought the news ahead of you."`
			`	She pauses and looks at you seriously. "We think it would be prudent for you to represent your people as our point of contact. Would you accept such a role?"`
			`	You give it a moment of thought.`
			choice
				`	"That seems practical."`
				`	"I don't really have an option to refuse, do I?"`
			`	"Fantastic, you understand the situation," she says, though her tone is much more businesslike than the wording would imply. "In that case, if you could please take this to Earth and communicate with your various governments, then we can begin a liaison on how best to deal with this current scenario."`
			`	She hands you an officially branded box containing a metallic badge. There is a symbol minutely engraved into the front that you remember seeing on your way into the complex, and must be the Hai government's emblem. Surrounding it in a circle is some sort of pattern, which reminds you of the codes found on identification cards and licenses in human space. On the other side, there is extensive writing in a script that looks to be Hai. From this, you presume that the badge is some sort of diplomatic ID.`
			choice
				`	"Various? We only have two governments."`
			`	"Oh," she says, "we've treated the Syndicate as a de facto government for many decades now; with the amount of influence they have it was the only prudent thing to do."`
			`	You take the boxed item with you, and an escort awaits to return you to your ship. As the door behind you closes, you hear Sayari mutter to someone, "It really was much easier when they just had one government though. What a mess."`

		log "People" "Xilin Yang" `Deputy Minister Yang works in the Foreign Affairs department of the Republic government. He is a pleasant and astute man. Handling the Hai secrecy crisis has become his job while the majority of the foreign ministry remains engaged with the fallout from the Free Worlds and recent peace.`
		conversation
			`On approach to the spaceport on Earth, you request to speak to an official of significant standing on diplomatic business. Thanks to your renown from the Pug war, you are able to shortcut objections stemming from you yourself not being a diplomat. The diplomatic ID from the box Sayari gave you, when presented, also seems to trigger some sort of classified override, fast-tracking the process from the quoted "two to three business days" to "two hours after landing."`
			`	The Republic's Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs meets you in a private room at the spaceport.`
			`	"Captain <last>," he steps around the table to grasp your hand in a firm handshake. "Xilin Yang. It's an honor to meet a hero of the Pug crisis such as yourself."`

			`	You shrug, palms up, and explain, "You should listen to the xenoanthropologists. The Pug were just here to test us, to make us really consider what mattered and come together."`
			`	For a moment his expression falters, and then he seems almost relieved. "You may be a better person than I expected to meet."`
			`	He offers you a genuine smile as he takes his seat.`
			label sit
			`	You sit down opposite him and explain how the Hai have proposed that you be their official contact point for humanity on account of your fame from the war.`
			`	He asks a few questions for clarity, and when you're done he requests you wait while he makes a call. He leaves the room for a long while, and at one point an aide comes in and offers you refreshments while deliberations continue elsewhere. Much to your surprise the fruity beverage is actually quite light and not too sweet, reminding you briefly that most of humanity's food styles originated here.`
			`	Eventually Mr. Yang returns. "So sorry for that. I hope you were looked after suitably while you waited."`
			`	Once you nod your assent, he continues, "Well, obviously the Republic knows about the Hai, but for the moment our official "line" is that the government does not trade in rumors. However, an appropriate response is clearly needed. Republic Intelligence briefed the Cabinet of the Free Worlds Senate just yesterday. They have demanded that they have a diplomatic representative along for any decisions. This is already standard practice for the Syndicate. If you are willing, I will come with you to meet two individuals known as Katya Reynolds and Samuel Remington on Deep and Foundry respectively. I believe you already know them?"`

Someone of Remington's caliber is likely too busy to come personally, but we'll find out when we get there. In any case I think we should go to Deep first for speed, but you are the captain. Shall we be off?"`

		conversation
			`When you land on Deep, Katya is there waiting for you along with Alondo. "<first>! It's so good to see you again! When the Republic briefed the new Chancellor and his Cabinet on the Hai, he brought us in for advice. We thought to try and reach you, but of course you would somehow manage to be in the thick of it before we even knew what was going on."`
			`	You hug them both in turn and return the greeting. "I thought it seemed odd when they said I was meeting you for this, Katya, but it makes much more sense if you were just easier to get a hold of than Alondo here."`
			`	"Oh, it was always going to be Alondo," she says, "but there's never a bad excuse for traveling with an old friend, especially when you're meeting other friends too."`
			`	"Do we have time for a drink before we leave?" asks Alondo.`
			`	You look around at the busy spaceport and see the workers haven't even noticed your ship waiting for refueling yet.`
			`	"I think we can spare a short while, and you really should meet Mr. Yang."`
			`	Mr. Yang had been studiously pretending he wasn't eavesdropping from a distance of a few meters but, before you could call him over, Alondo's slightly suggestive comment of, "Oh, I should definitely meet Mr. Yang," had evidently been overheard.`

Hopefully it doesn't conflict with resolving the situation with the Hai.`
		conversation
			`Approaching Foundry, you are hailed and directed to a private hangar where you are greeted personally by Samuel Remington. His appearance is rather casual compared to what you would expect, wearing khakis and a collared tee as opposed to the typical suit and tie business attire that you see on Syndicate businessmen. It is certainly in contrast to a young woman standing behind him, who is wearing the usual business attire in this region.`

She seems at once pleasant and approachable while at the same time being slightly off-putting and uncanny. It's an eerie feeling.`

"I have men who can hold the fort here while I'm gone, and I really do need to get some fresh air, so the two of us will be joining you. There is an internal political situation going on within the Syndicate that has been causing me quite the headache recently." His eyes momentarily flick to Terry as he says that, but Remington presses on immediately. "It's nothing I can discuss in detail, with all the NDAs involved, you know, but something I'll certainly enjoy taking a break from.`
