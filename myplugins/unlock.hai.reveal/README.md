In 0.10.0 HR was disabled, and restricted to just the intro, in 0.10.1, Two starting missions for HR, that is, Hai Leaks Response 1 and 2, were removed, That meant HR could no longer be triggered at more

this plugin adds Hai Leaks Response 1 and 2, and re enables the disabled mission, letting you play the HR line




Rightful credits to SomeTroglodyte and everyone involved in discussion #9161 for providing me the framework to understand and make this plugin

repair hai reveal.txt(and the icon.png) was originally made by SomeTroglodyte for version 0.10.2, it was highly edited by me, which involved deleting the pre existing missions, and updating the added mission as per the latest release

the fix was, as they stated, incomplete, that is, the condition "Hai Leaks Response 2: done" was impossible to get, this was fixed by me in tweaks.txt
